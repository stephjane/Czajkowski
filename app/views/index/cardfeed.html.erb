          <p class="padding">An independent project, CardFeed began as an idea designed and tailored to a single classmate's interests and needs. After an initial interview, the idea took shape as a news and content curator based on the user's interests. I later revisited the idea to expand user testing to others and elaborate on the first iteration. After four rounds of user testing and three primary iterations, CardFeed's final prototype features the ability to filter content by audio, text and video and move through the app with simple swipe motions.</p></br>

          <p>The initial user interview pinpointed areas the user felt he could be served more efficiently. Together we decided a path for my design to pursue.</p>

          <h4>Prototyping + User Testing</h4>
          <p>Using the first prototype, I expanded user testing by sketching out additional ideas and observing user preference and interaction behavior. I repeated this step after the next three iterations to reach the final prototype.</p>
