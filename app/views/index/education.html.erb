			<p class="education">I received formal UX design training while enrolled in General Assembly's 10 week UXDI Immersion program. With over 400 hours of class time, this course covered multiple areas of UX design including user testing, prototyping, information architecture, user flows, and site mapping. We also covered visual design basics including typography and color.</br>
			Axure, Sketch and Invision are just a few of the Software used in the completion of five projects.</p>

			<p class="education2">In the summer of 2015, I enrolled in Tech Talent South's Web Development Immersion program. The structure of this program was very conducive to learning, with each day spent building a different project together. Before diving into Ruby on Rails, we covered HTML and CSS. We then built multiple web applications with Ruby on Rails, at times in teams to for experience with Github collaboration. A demo of my final, individual project for this course can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Q4B4C-4tkYo">here</a>.</p>
